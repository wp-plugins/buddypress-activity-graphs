== Description ==

BuddyPress Activity Graphs allows a BuddyPress install to display various graphs and visualisations on a user's profile page.

Visualisations are of

1. A pie chart of different activities
2. A graph showing activities over time
3. A pie chart showing fora posted in
4. A pie chart of who you have @'ed
5. A tag cloud of the words you've used on the site
(See the screenshots for more)

This plugin makes use of the D3 visualisation plugin so won't work in older browsers.

You can also write new activity graphs as the plugin can be extended.

The plugin is new and keen to take on feedback to improve it.

== Installation ==

You can download and install using the built in WordPress plugin installer. 
If you download manually, make sure the folder is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/".

Activate the plugin in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link.
